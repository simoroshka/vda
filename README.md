The rotor-router algorithm balances the distribution of tokens in a network. The goal of the project was to create a visualization for demonstration and observation of the algorithm’s behaviour and properties. The project includes an interactive animation of the algorithm, graph (network) import, export and manipulation, cycle and path finding and drawing. The visualization is written in Javascript and runs in a browser.
